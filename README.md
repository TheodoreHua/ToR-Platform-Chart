![GitHub repo size](https://img.shields.io/github/repo-size/TheodoreHua/ToR-Platform-Chart)

An *unofficial* repository of references (and sometimes unofficial templates) for various platforms that r/TranscribersOfReddit users may come across. (Partly inspired by u/Halailah and [ToR-Repost-Collection](https://github.com/codingJWilliams/ToR-Repost-Collection)).

The example screenshots are either created by me, taken from Reddit, or from various other image websites.

Keep in mind, when in doubt, ask the mods (or other transcribers). Also keep in mind that when copying an unofficial template in the repo, copy the raw text (click the `Raw` button in the file) or the formatting won't appear properly in reddit.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are always appreciated and help a lot (both me and future users). In the case that you don't know how, you may ask me in the ToR Discord (either to have me just add it or to learn how to create a PR). If you don't know where to start, go to the issues page and pick one of them that hasn't been taken by someone else. Then comment that you're doing it so that others don't work on it as the same time as you (if you're a contributor, you can self-assign the issue). If you would like to be added as a contributor, message me on discord.

There may also of those boxes to the left of the most bottom right box, that happens if the question/answer is edited. In order to tell whether a screenshot is a question or an answer, look at the text before the date in the rectangle. A question fill have the text `asked` and an answer will have the text `answered`. Similar to Reddit, Stack Exchange has sub-categories (like subreddits). Stack Overflow, which is used in this example, is one of them.
